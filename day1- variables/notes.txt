Rules for Python variables:

1. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
2. A variable name cannot start with a number
3. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
4. Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
5. The reserved words(keywords) cannot be used naming the variable.
